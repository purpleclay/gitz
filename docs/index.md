# Gitz

TODO: paste this text onto the README.md of this project

- this is not a standalone tool and requires the presence of the git client
- the version of git installed will impact the gitz library
- if you need a full blown git library with no client dependency, checkout go-git
- fluent interactions, easy to customise, programmatic interaction with git is a breeze
