# Fetching the latest changes from a remote

[:simple-git:{ .git-icon } Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch)

Fetch all remote changes from a remote repository without integrating (merging) them into the current repository (working directory). Ensures the current repository only tracks the latest remote changes.
