# Installing the Package

Use `go get` to pull the `gitz` package as a dependency within your `go.mod` file:

```{ .text .no-select }
go get github.com/purpleclay/gitz
```

Then to get started, import the package into your project:

```{ .go .no-select }
import git "github.com/purpleclay/gitz"
```

And that's it!
